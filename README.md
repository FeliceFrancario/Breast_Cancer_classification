 In this project we exploited Survival analysis methods and
 Shrinkage methods to predict the survival probability of patients
 who underwent breast cancer surgery using their clinical and
 genetic information. The following models were used: Survival
 Analysis using the Cox proportional Hazard Model with 3 different
 types of regularization: Lasso, Ridge and Elastic Net; Logistic
 Regression with the same 3 different types of regularization and
 Group Lasso; Sparse SVM with hinge and squared hinge loss
